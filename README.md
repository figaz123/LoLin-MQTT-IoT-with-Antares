# LoLin MQTT IoT with Antares
This is a prototype of early warning system with IoT using NodeMCU v3(LoLin) and antares as IoT platform. For Antares library we use Antares MQTT version 0.9.2 and NodeMCU boards manager version 2.4.2.

for the sensor we use those are HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and arduino water sensor, also we use buzzer as an actuator in this project.
